You may wish to refer to ["How do I submit diagnostics?"](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/Diagnostics)
and other [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/) related to
[forking, cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone),
and [pull requests](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this diagnostic.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
 some of the most common sources of errors.
You can test whether or not your script is working by adding some `console.log`
 statements to the script and serving up the Ember app.
